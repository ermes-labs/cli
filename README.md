# Query Language

Queries can target specific areas using their identifiers and filter them:

- `#AreaId`: Targets a specific area by its unique identifier.
- `AreaId(filters...)`: Targets a specific area by its unique identifier.
- `*(filters...)`: A wildcard character representing all areas.

## Filters

Filters allow for refined queries based on specific criteria, multiple filters can be combine

- **Tag Filters**: Specify conditions based on tags assigned to nodes. The syntax for a tag filter is `tag:<key>=<value>`, where Key is the tag name, and Value is the tag value. <br> e.g. `tag:key=value`
- **Level Filters**: Define conditions based on the hierarchical level of nodes. The syntax for a level filter is `level<op><number>` is a comparison operator `(<, <=, >, >=, =, !=)`, and Numb is an integer representing the level.
  Filters can be combined within a single query to apply multiple criteria:

mathematica
Copy code
AreaId(tag:Key=Value, level<Comp>Numb)
Sets and Operations
Queries can be grouped into sets, allowing for union and difference operations to combine or exclude specific areas:

less
Copy code
{ #AreaId1 + #AreaId2 - #AreaId3 }
{}: Encloses a set of area queries.
+: Adds areas to the set (union operation).
-: Removes areas from the set (difference operation).
Formal Language Definition
The formal grammar of the query language is defined as follows:

```ts
Query       ::= Set
Set         ::= "#" Ident | "*" | NodesInArea | "{" Sets "}"
NodesInArea ::= Ident { "(" Filters ")" }*
Filters     ::= Filter { "," Filter }*
Filter      ::= TagFilter | LevelFilter
TagFilter   ::= "tag:" Ident "=" String
LevelFilter ::= "level" Comp Number
Sets        ::= Set { Op Set }*
Op          ::= "+" | "-"
Ident       ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
String      ::= [^,)]+
Number      ::= [-+]?[0-9]+
Comp        ::= "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "=" | "!="

Ident: An identifier starting with a letter or underscore, followed by any combination of letters, digits, and underscores.
String: A sequence of characters representing tag values, excluding commas and closing parentheses.
Number: An integer, which may include an optional sign.
Comp: Comparison operators used in level filters.
Examples
Query a single area by its identifier:
```

bash
Copy code
#Downtown
Query all areas:

markdown
Copy code

- Apply a tag filter to an area:

scss
Copy code
ParkArea(tag:type=park)
Apply multiple filters to an area:

scss
Copy code
ResidentialArea(tag:status=active, level>=2)
Combine multiple area queries into a set with operations:

less
Copy code
{ #Commercial + #Industrial - #Restricted }
